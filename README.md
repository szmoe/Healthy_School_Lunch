# Healthy_School_Lunch
The lunch service model was made with aim to improve nutrition of school children and increase school funding. 

However, the current model has a major flaw that it was not modeled based on an existing school design; hence, does not reflect a real life scenario. All of the values and the input variables are just fragments of my imagination where I strive to see a positive result. Thus, the model itself is a bias. 

Although the results of the model seems promising as driven by my imaginary inputs, the same results may not be obtained, depending on the factors such as the attitude and behaviour of the decision makers and stakholders, the extent to which funding may be available,etc. In other words, the applicability of the model is limited to a single scenario only. New input variables and new estimates are required for each different scenario, resulting in widely differing outcomes.

A valuable knowledge I gained from this simulation practice is my understanding of how important the estimates are in forecasting an outcome. The more calibrated my knowledge is for a particular matter at hand, the closer my estimates will be to the truth. That ability will set apart the evidence-based scientific forecasts from those biased "crystal-ball" forecasts.

To wrap up, the lunch service model has many flaws that it will not be useable without major corrective measures. However, it may serve as a canvas on which a detailed blueprint of a case-specific model can be mapped out.
